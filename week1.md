# DAY 1
# COMMON NUMBER SYSTEM

* **Decimal (Base 10):** The standard number system using digits 0–9.
* **Binary (Base 2):** A system using only 0 and 1, used by computers.
* **Octal (Base 8):** A system using digits 0–7, used in some computer applications.
* **Hexadecimal (Base 16):** A system using 0–9 and A–F, often used in programming.

## NUMBER SYSTEM CONVERSION

### BINARY TO DECIMAL
Here are  the steps:
1. **Write down the binary number.**
2. **Assign powers of 2** to each bit starting from the right (2^0, 2^1, 2^2, …).
3. **Multiply each bit** by its corresponding power of 2.
4. **Add all the results** to get the decimal number.
   

### DECIMAL TO BINARY
Here are the steps:
1. **Divide by 2 repeatedly**, noting each remainder.
2. **Stop when quotient is 0**.
3. **Write remainders in reverse order** for the binary number.


### DECIMAL TO OCTAL 
Here are the steps :
1. **Divide the decimal number by 8 repeatedly**, noting each remainder.
2. **Stop when quotient is 0**.
3. **Write remainders in reverse order** to get the octal number.

### OCTAL TO DECIMAL
Here are the steps :
1. **Write down the octal number.**
2. **Assign powers of 8** to each digit starting from the right (8^0, 8^1, 8^2, …).
3. **Multiply each digit** by its corresponding power of 8.
4. **Add all the results** to get the decimal number.

### HEXADECIMAL TO DECIMAL
Here are the steps :
1. **Write down the hexadecimal number.**
2. **Assign powers of 16** to each digit starting from the right (16^0, 16^1, 16^2, …).
3. **Convert each hex digit to decimal** (A=10, B=11, …, F=15).
4. **Multiply each digit’s decimal value** by its corresponding power of 16.
5. **Add all the results** to get the decimal number.

### BINARY TO OCTAL
Here are the steps :
1. **Group the binary digits into sets of 3**, starting from the right. Add leading zeros if needed.
2. **Convert each group of 3 bits** to its octal equivalent.
3. **Write the octal digits in order** for the final octal number.

### BINARY TO HEXADECIMAL
Here are the steps :
1. **Group the binary digits into sets of 4**, starting from the right. Add leading zeros if needed.
2. **Convert each group of 4 bits** to its hexadecimal equivalent.
3. **Write the hexadecimal digits in order** for the final hex number.

### OCTAL TO HEXADECIMAL
Here are the steps :
1. **Convert the octal number to binary.**
   * Replace each octal digit with its **3-bit binary equivalent**.
2. **Group the binary digits into sets of 4**, starting from the right. Add leading zeros if needed.
3. **Convert each 4-bit group to hexadecimal.**
4. **Write the hexadecimal digits in order** for the final result.

### HEXADECIMAL TO OCTAL
Here are the steps :
1. **Convert the hexadecimal number to binary.**
   * Replace each hex digit with its **4-bit binary equivalent**.
2. **Group the binary digits into sets of 3**, starting from the right. Add leading zeros if needed.
3. **Convert each 3-bit group to octal.**
4. **Write the octal digits in order** for the final octal number.

### HEXADECIMAL TO BINARY
Here are the steps:
1. **Write down the hexadecimal number.**
2. **Replace each hex digit with its 4-bit binary equivalent.**
3. **Combine all the binary groups** for the final binary number.

### OCTAL TO BINARY
Here are the steps:
1. **Write down the octal number.**
2. **Replace each octal digit with its 3-bit binary equivalent.**
3. **Combine all the binary groups** for the final binary number.
